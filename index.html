		<h2><em>James Webb Space telescope image evidence of universe origin</em></h2>

       <p><big><big><big><big>T</big></big></big></big>he James Webb Space Telescope's spectacular image of the deep infrared universe has uncovered 42 new, lensed images of galaxies and revealed in unprecedented depth the shape of the lens, which may eventually help us to see the very first galaxies.

The reveal of the James Webb Space Telescope deep-field image, by U.S. President Joe Biden in a special White House event held on July 11, was a closely guarded secret. Teams of astronomers raced to be the first to analyze it, with three new papers being posted to the community's preprint server within a week of the image's release.

"We were kinda sideswiped, to be honest!" Brenda Frye, an astronomer at Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona and co-author of one of the papers, told Space.com. "Normally we have a year or two advance warning, but no one saw [this release] coming at this time."

The galaxy cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327, known as SMACS J0723 for short, is among a set of galaxy clusters that Webb is imaging for various gravitational-lensing surveys. Beyond that, said Frye, there was nothing exceptional about SMACS J0723 — until now.

"It was beautifully chosen [to be one of the first images] because it was a relatively unknown target," she said.

Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon in which a very massive object's gravity warps space into a shape analogous to an optical lens, resulting in light from whatever is behind the lens being distorted and magnified in brightness. Galaxy clusters are particularly efficient lenses because they pack a huge amount of mass (in the case of SMACS J0723, about 100 trillion times the mass of the sun) into a relatively compact volume with a diameter of about 3 to 5 million light-years across. 

Previous surveys by the Hubble Space Telescope and the retired Herschel Space Observatory had found a handful of lensed images of background galaxies in their SMACS J0723 observations. But Webb takes the hunt to a whole new level.

Frye's team, which was led by graduate student Massimo Pascale at the University of California, Berkeley, discovered 42 new lensed images in the background of the new deep-field image. Gravitational lenses can create multiple images of the same galaxy, so these 42 images represent 19 individual galaxies. Another team, led by Gabriel Caminha of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Germany, counted 27 new lensed images. 

Whatever the final tally, these lensed images allow scientists to finetune a map of how matter — both visible and dark — is distributed in the SMACS J0723 cluster, and in turn model the shape of the lens. One of the new papers, from a team led by Guillaume Mahler of Durham University, concluded that most of the mass is centered on the brightest, most massive galaxy in the cluster.

		<h2><em>Best star projectors: Indoor views of the night sky</em></h2>
        <h3> date:July-25-2022</h3>
           </div>

        
        <img src="image/shiva2.png" class="img">
       
       <p><big><big><big><big>W</big></big></big></big>hat if you could bring the night sky inside? The best star projectors create a similar awe-inspiring environment in your home. They fill walls and ceilings with stars, constellations and more to create an immersive experience that can spark imaginations, add a fun vibe to a party or help you drift off to sleep. They are all easy to set up and use but star projectors come in many shapes and sizes, and suit a range of budgets as vast as the night sky itself. 
       Like most products, with star projectors, you generally get what you pay for. While those at the more affordable end of the market tend to concentrate on filling rooms with lights and color and mostly novelty-style ambient projections, the more you pay, the more scientific accuracy you get and the closer you get to a planetarium-style experience. If the intended recipient is a child with a keen interest in the night sky, go for the latter as they are more impressive and educational. 

Here at Space.com, we've cast our eye over the market for the best star projectors, reviewed a number of them, and rounded up the best for bringing the stars, planets and galaxies indoorsWe don't know what we love most about the Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector(opens in new tab) from Encalife: the exquisite 16.7 million nebula colors to choose from or the ability to control this projector with our voice with Alexa and Google. To boot, it boasts a sleek design that's sure to delight many: it's modern and compact, which allows the user to place it pretty much anywhere in the household. There are even four angles to adjust this unit to, so it's versatile enough to project either onto the wall or ceiling from your chosen surface. 
Not only is the Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector easy to sync up for seamless voice control, but you can also change the colors, modify brightness and adjust the speed just by speaking. There's also the option to issue commands through your smartphone after pairing with a Smart App (compatible with Android and iOS). It's here where things get even more impressive: using the color wheel on your device, it's possible to slide through various tones, from cool blue to warm fiery red. What's more, there's a blend of 16.7 million hues to choose from, though, from our Atmosphere Smart Galaxy review we found that those 16.7 million colors aren't that distinguishable.

The only downside with the Atmosphere Smart Galaxy Projector is that the nebulas and stars aren't scientifically accurate. Still, we enjoyed the experience so much that we didn't feel short-changed. We were particularly delighted with the option to be able to change the speed of the projection along with the brightness, making this device an excellent tool for creating a relaxing ambiance or a lively party scene.</p>
